# -GCX-APPS
You need GC BUILDER installed to run those apps.

CORE folder :
- Install GC Builder from there. Choose the core you want to install, for windows or linux.

SOURCE folder :
- Download gcs projects source codes from there, and run them with the cores!

APPS folder :
- Download gcx installable from there and intall it. But you need to install the required core, GC Manager and GC Launcher to install them.

Thanks!
