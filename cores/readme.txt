This is GC BUILDER Binaries, the tools whish will allow you to run gcx apps and gcs files. Here you will get all last versions of every core.
If you've never used GC Builder, please follow what i will say :

- To install only a package
  If you want to install a single package like GC Win32 for example, just download it and unzip it. You will find a file named "install", just launch it.
  A command line dialog will apear for a short time and okay, it's done!
  
  For every other packages you find there, there is a "install" file, so you won't be confused.
  
 - To install all the cores :
  You have to install the cores in the following order :
  
  - Firstly, install GC Builder win32 core. It contains the very first core released.
  - Then, install GC Builder Tk core. It contains the core wich run tk apps.
  - Then, you can install the other tools.


- HOW TO RUN GCX Files:
  If you've installed GC Manager, just open your gcx file with it.
