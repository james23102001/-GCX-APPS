This is GC BUILDER Binaries, the tools whish will allow you to run gcx apps and gcs files. Here you will get all last versions of every core.
If you've never used GC Builder, please follow what i will say :

What you need : 

( On windows )
  - Download GC Builder for win32 apps or GC_tk for tk apps, and install it. So you can run the code usinng cmd. Type this command line from the source code directory.
  
  C:\GC\cores\GC_win32 home.ch
  
  to run a win32 app or
  
  C:\GC\cores\GC_tk
  
  to run a tk app.
  
  As you may notice it, it's kinda easier to run it from .bat files. You will find run.bat and run_tk.bat in the C:\GC folder.

( On Linux )
  - Download GC_tk linux version in this directory. Unzip it, an place it in the source code folder you want and run it. Just place GC_tk in the source code, next to home.ch file, and it's running.
  
 ( non-developpers note )
  - If you need to install apps from gcx and not simply run source codes, so install GC Manager and GC Launcher too. Run your .gcx file with GC Manager to install it, and you can run it in GC Launcher!
 
- To install only a package
  If you want to install a single package like GC Win32 for example, just download it and unzip it. You will find a file named "install", just launch it.
  A command line dialog will apear for a short time and okay, it's done!
  
  For every other packages you find there, there is a "install" file, so you won't be confused.
  
 - To install all the cores :
  You have to install the cores in the following order :
  
  - Firstly, install GC Builder win32 core. It contains the very first core released.
  - Then, install GC Builder Tk core. It contains the core wich run tk apps.
  - Then, you can install the other tools.

- HOW TO RUN GCX Files:
  If you've installed GC Manager, just open your gcx file with it. GC manager will install the app for you. Beware : To run an app, you need to get the right core for it! Once you've installed your app with GC Manager, you can find it inside GC Launcher!
  
 - Developpers note :
  docs folder contains documentations for each core, but pardon me, they are not up-to date; you may discover new functions or syntaxes in the source files. Anyway, i would be happy to help if you're confused about anything!
