***Roles:
A Simple notepad with save, load and quit actions

***Requirements:
Requires nothing.

***Message:
I hope this will help. Just notify : 
1 ) Creating executable file or debug file with gc manager won't work because of the space in "Text Editor".
2 ) Installing from folder won't work, please install from archive.
3 ) Debugging will notice Open TEXT as an error, but it actually isn't. Don't notice it.
This is a GC programm, you can't run it if you haven't at leasr GC_Builder Client edition. 
Thanks for using!
